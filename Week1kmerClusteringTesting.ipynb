    "**Brief project history:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Thomas Pedersen was a UAMS PhD student who originally created [FindMyFriends](https://github.com/thomasp85/FindMyFriends) to be able to rapidly construct the pangenome (core and accessory genes) across multliple bacterial genomes quickly and accurately. The program first uses an algorithm called [CD-Hit](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11294794) to quickly group the genes into broad groups, and then the gene clusters are split into smaller clusters based on k-mer similarity and neighboring sequences (to separate orthologues (difference from speciation) from paralogues (difference from duplication)). Once the genes are grouped, it can be determined to what degree certain genes are shared between the genomes that were fed to the algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "While Thomas was working on FindMyFriends, a separate pan-genome construction algorithm was published called [Roary](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4817141/). Roary accomplished the same task faster, so Thomas decided to use design elements like CD-Hit from Roary to improve the speed of FindMyFriends. Once Thomas graduated with his PhD, FindMyFriends was left in an unfinished state. *Consequently, the goal of this project is to replace the CD-Hit pre-clustering step with a kmer-counting algorithm to try to restore functionality and accuracy to FindMyFriends.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research Notes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs like PanOCT and PGAP run all-against-all BLASTs across the input genomes, but this scales quadratically with computation time and memory usage, so it becomes impractical to use these programs for large amounts of data. Roary (and FindMyFriends) instead use kmer counting. If two sequences are similar, they must exactly share a certain number of short sequences (kmers). In the original CD-Hit paper, they provide an example: \"[T]wo sequences having 85% identical residues over a 100-residue window will have at least 70 identical dipeptides,55 tripeptides and 25 pentapeptides\" (Li et al., 2001). Sequences can then be quickly compared and grouped so that a BLAST does not have to be run for all of them. The problem with the CD-Hit algorithm (as used in the latest version of FindMyFriends) is that once it groups the genomes based on kmer counts, it randomly chooses a representative sample from each group to be BLASTed against other groups. This eliminates reproducible results when running the algorithm. \n",
