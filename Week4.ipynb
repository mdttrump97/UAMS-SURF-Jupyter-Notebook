I modified the kmer counting program to output the matrices in matrix market format which stores the coordinates of each data point and the value without storing any of the zeroes from the sparse matrix. Saving and loading these files instead of the large sparse count matrices greatly reduced runtime! \n",

    "Amino acids such as tyrosine, phenylalanine, and histidine are present in low amounts, but are not completely rare in the genomes, so kmers containing these amino acids may be useful for distinguishing genomes. Instead of picking specific amino acids, we decided to try to use charged kmers to cluster the proteins from each genome. All of the charged amino acids (Histidine (H), Lysine (K), Aspartate (D), Glutamate (E), and Arginine (R)) are all moderately used, but not nearly as common as amino acids like Leucine (L), Alanine (A), and Glycine (G). I modified multigenomeCSVGenerator to incorporate the top 3 most occurrent charged k-mers alongside the top 3 most occurrent kmers overall. The code was modified to leave out top x charged kmers that were already top x kmers in general to avoid duplicates, so the vector results for the some sample proteins gave: <img src=\"images/w4/vector_nonduplicate.png\" width = \"600\"/>"
