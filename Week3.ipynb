    "To start out today, I decided to make a smaller .csv file to test the python canopy clustering code. I used Multigenome_CSV_Generator.py to generate one large .csv file of counts of the top 10 kmers from the previously generated .csv files from 10 genomes. I then tried to run my python code for canopy clustering. While running, the .csv file stored in a data frame used about 16 GB of RAM, and the CPU load of my mac grew sharply when trying to calculate the distance matrix. I was able to get lots of small clusters since the cluster cut-off values were lower than the distance values from the Euclidean metric. I then switched the distance metric to cosine similarity (range -1 to 1) and tried to find a good cut-off value for canopy inclusion. Once I had good clustering, I tried to generate a list of groupings to import into FindMyFriends using the manualGrouping() method. For this, I generated a list where the list index was a protein, and the value of the list at that index was the grouping of the protein. Once I examined the grouping list, I then realized that the code had an error; points were being clustered multiple times. I fixed that issue and finalized the code:"
